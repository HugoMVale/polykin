# PolyKin Tutorials

These Jupyer notebook tutorials are designed to showcase the key features of PolyKin.
They are suitable for self-learning as well as for classroom instruction.

To run the tutorials, you may use one of two methods:

* **[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)** — The notebooks can be opened
directly from the source code repository ("File -> Open notebook -> GitHub -> URL") using the
following repo name: `HugoMVale/polykin`. This method requires a Google account.

* **Local environment** — Alternatively, you may download a copy of the `.ipynb` files from the
[tutorials folder](https://github.com/HugoMVale/polykin/tree/main/docs/tutorials) and run them
locally. This method requires a local Python + Jupyer notebook installation.
