# PolyKin Tutorials

These Jupyer notebook tutorials are designed to showcase the key features of PolyKin.
They are suitable for self-learning as well as for classroom instruction.

To run the tutorials, you may use one of several methods:

* **[Binder](https://mybinder.org/)** — To access a live version of the content, simply
click on the "launch binder" button provided at the top of each tutorial. This method has no
requirements, but please keep in mind that setting up the environment in Binder may take some
time on certain occasions.

* **[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)** — The notebooks can be opened
directly from the source code repository ("File -> Open notebook -> GitHub -> URL") using the
following repo name: `HugoMVale/polykin`. This method requires a Google account.

* **Local environment** — Alternatively, you may download a copy of the `.ipynb` files from the
[tutorials folder](https://github.com/HugoMVale/polykin/tree/main/docs/tutorials) and run them
locally. This method requires a local Python + Jupyer notebook installation.
