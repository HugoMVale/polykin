# Installation

`PolyKin` requires Python >= 3.10, because it makes use of recent type hint syntax. It further relies on a number of mature and well-maintained mathematical/scientific libraries:
`matplotlib`, `mpmath`, `numba`, `numpy`, `pydantic`, `scipy`, etc.

## Install from PyPI

With `pip` do:

```bash
pip install polykin
```

With [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) do:

```bash
uv add polykin
```

## Install from the source code repository

The very latest code (no guarantee it will work!) may be installed directly from the source code repository:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/HugoMVale/polykin.git
```

or

```bash
uv add git+https://github.com/HugoMVale/polykin.git
```
