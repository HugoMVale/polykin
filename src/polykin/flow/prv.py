    device in gas or steam service (single-phase flow). 

    The calculation is done according to the API standard 520. No distinction 
    is made between gas and vapor (synomyms in this context). 

    The calculation method relies on assumptions whose validity diminishes as 
    the gas approaches the critical point. Typically, the reduced volume of the
    relieving gas should be greater than 2.0.

    Parameters
    ----------
    W : float
        Required relieving mass flow rate (kg/h).
    P1 : float
        Upstream relieving pressure, absolute (bara).
    P2 : float
        Downstream back pressure, absolute (bara).

        Molar mass of gas (g/mol).
    Z : float
        Compressibility factor of the gas at relieving pressure and temperature.
        If a calculated value is not available, use `Z=1.0`, which leads to a 
        conservative estimate of the discharge area. 
    steam : bool
        Flag for steam service. A special calculation is used for devices in
        steam service that operate at critical (sonic) flow conditions.
    Kd: float

        `Kd=0.62` when sizing a rupture disk without PRV.
    Kb : float
        Backpressure correction factor for balanced bellows valves. The value
        can be obtained from the manufacturer or estimated with the help of 
        Figure 31 of the API standard 520.
    Kc : float
        Combination correction factor for installations with a rupture disk
        upstream of the PRV. Use `Kc=1.0` if there is no rupture disk, and
        `Kc=0.9` if there is a rupture disk.
    KSH : float
        Steam superheat correction factor. Use `KSH=1.0` for saturated steam.
        For superheated steam, the value can be obtained from Tables 12 or 13
        of the API standard 520.
