## Documentation

Please refer to the package [homepage](https://hugomvale.github.io/polykin/).

## Tutorials

The main features of PolyKin are explained and illustrated through a series of [tutorials](https://hugomvale.github.io/polykin/tutorials/) based on Jupyter [notebooks](https://github.com/HugoMVale/polykin/tree/main/docs/tutorials),
which can be launched online via Binder.

## Installation

PolyKin currently runs on Python 3.9+. You can install it from PyPI via `pip` (or `poetry`):

```console
pip install polykin
# poetry add polykin
```

Alternatively, you may install it directly from the source code repository:

```console
git clone https://github.com/HugoMVale/polykin.git
cd polykin
pip install . 
# poetry install
```
