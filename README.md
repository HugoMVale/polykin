PolyKin is an open-source polymerization kinetics library for Python. It is still in its
infancy, but some modules are already in a functional state:

- [x] distributions
- [ ] copolymerization  
 

## Documentation

* This readme (start with that).
* Package [homepage](https://hugomvale.github.io/polykin/).


## Installation

PolyKin currently runs on Python 3.9 or higher. You can install it from PyPI via `pip` (or `poetry`):
```
pip install polykin
# poetry add polykin
```

Alternatively, you may install it directly from the source code repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/HugoMVale/polykin.git
cd polykin
pip install . 
# poetry install
```

## Examples, tutorials

For all modules, there are comprehensive [tutorials](https://hugomvale.github.io/polykin/tutorials/distributions/)
 based on Jupyter [notebooks](https://github.com/HugoMVale/polykin/tree/main/docs/tutorials).
