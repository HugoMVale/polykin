PolyKin is an open-source polymerization kinetics library for Python. It is still at an early
development stage, but the following modules can already be used:

- [x] distributions
- [ ] copolymerization
- [ ] kinetics
- [ ] database
- [ ] models

## Documentation

Please refer to the package [homepage](https://hugomvale.github.io/polykin/).

## Tutorials

The main features of PolyKin are explained and illustrated through a series of [tutorials](https://hugomvale.github.io/polykin/tutorials/distributions/) based on Jupyter [notebooks](https://github.com/HugoMVale/polykin/tree/main/docs/tutorials),
which can be launched online via Binder.
